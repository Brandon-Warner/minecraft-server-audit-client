Project takes a CSV file input of Minecraft Server urls and outputs server hostname, IP, active status, current versions, current players online, maximum players allowed, block-status, last time of block, and upon clicking the 'Mode' button will tell you if the server is in offline mode. 


Sample file link shows the formatting needed for the application to process the data correctly.


Built with React.js, Redux, Material UI, and SheetJS.
